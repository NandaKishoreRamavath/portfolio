When I began collaborating with them, the focus was on strengthening their digital identity — giving the brand a visual presence that felt authentic, memorable, and emotionally grounded.\n\nWhat started with a few poster designs quickly evolved into a deeper creative partnership. I developed a consistent visual language for their social media — combining rich, earthy tones of royal blue, brown, and cream with typography and textures inspired by Indian art and culture. The goal was to make each post feel like a story, not an ad — something that carried emotion, family, and tradition.\n\nImpressed by the brand’s new direction, the client extended the collaboration beyond digital content. I was later entrusted with designing a refreshed logo and a custom jersey for their sponsored sports team — blending legacy with modern design sensibility.\n\nThrough this project, I realized how powerful consistent storytelling can be. BigB Mehndi’s identity now stands as a refined blend of tradition and modernity — built not just on visuals, but on emotion and meaning.",

The website redesign transforms their technical innovation into an elegant, credible digital experience.\n\nThe Challenge\nThe existing site lacked clarity and modern functionality — cluttered navigation and weak hierarchy failed to communicate the brand's cutting-edge capabilities. The brief was to revamp while preserving AgroSky's identity, then elevate it with sophistication and seamless performance.\n\nDesign Approach\nDeep maroon and earthy cream reflect agricultural roots and modern innovation. Clean layouts, strategic white space, and bold imagery create hierarchy that guides users through complex offerings without overwhelming them. High-quality visuals paired with concise descriptions build trust, while icons and infographics translate technical data into digestible insights.\n\nDevelopment\nBuilt on the MERN stack for performance and scalability, the site delivers smooth navigation, fast load times, and full responsiveness across devices. Dynamic product filtering, intuitive service sections, and strategic CTAs drive engagement while maintaining visual integrity from desktop to mobile.\n\nOutcome\nThe revamped platform positions AgroSky as a future-ready agri-tech leader — blending credibility with accessibility. It's a digital experience that informs, inspires confidence, and drives meaningful engagement with farmers, partners, and stakeholders.",

But the more I worked on it, the more I got obsessed with the small stuff — how light wraps around wood, how surface roughness changes the mood, how tiny shadows define shape.\n\nThe wooden chair was a pure studio setup — I wanted it to feel like a real product shot, something you could almost touch. Every edge, grain, and reflection was carefully balanced until it felt right.\n\nThen came the couch. I wanted to go beyond just modeling — so I threw it into a real-world scene, blending 3D with actual footage. It was my first try at matching lighting, color tone, and shadows with VFX, and it honestly taught me more than any tutorial ever could.\n\nWhat started as a random experiment turned into something bigger — a reminder that design isn’t just about creating what looks good, it’s about learning how every detail comes together to make it feel real.",
